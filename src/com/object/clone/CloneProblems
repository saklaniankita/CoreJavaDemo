Process of deep cloning in Java, conflicts with proper use of final fields, because if your Mutable object is a final field,
you can not reassign copied values inside clone method.

Five ways to copy object : (new, Class.newInstance(), Constructor.newInstance(), clone(), and deserialization)

Though serialization provides deep cloning but serialization is not solving any problems because 
we will still not be able to modify the final fields, 
we still don’t have any control on object construction, and we still need to implement Serializable, 
which is similar to Cloneable. Plus, the serialization process is slower than Object.clone().

Copy Constructor looks best of all solutions.
