==> Why do we need instance block when we have constructors?
    Say, we have more than one constructors, each performing a specific initialization. And each constructor has few lines
    of codes which is common for every constructor. Here we can make use of instance block and put those common lines
    of code in the instance block instead of putting them in every constructor. That will reduce the number of lines
    of code.
    
==> Nested classes can be static AND Outer class can NEVER be static 
    Static keyword is associated with the class and not with any instance.
    Whatever is static(Ex: Variable, method, block, inner class) gets associated with the Main class.
    Making any outer class static doesn't make any sense
