/**
 * 
 * If a server creates a new thread for every requests, then it will be very
 * time consuming and will waste system resources. System may run out of memory.
 * So we need to limit the number of threads and reuse the already existing
 * threads for new jobs
 * 
 * A thread pool reuses previously created threads to execute current tasks and
 * offers a solution to the problem of thread cycle overhead and resource
 * thrashing. So this groupof worker threads is called Thread Pool
